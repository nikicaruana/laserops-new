-- =============================================================================
-- Open games are LaserOps-organised only: restrict create_player_match to
-- admins. Players were able to create public "open" games (auto-titled
-- "LaserOps Open Match ..." or any title they typed), indistinguishable from
-- official ones, and could then delete them. Players keep PRIVATE bookings
-- (create_private_booking) - this only gates OPEN-game creation. Same body as
-- 20260814000100 with an is_admin guard added at the top.
